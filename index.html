                <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he wishes.</li>
                <li>Each result will get added to his round's score. But if the player rolls a double six all his round's score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>A player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round's score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The first player to reach the target points wins - points Range from 50-999</li>
